house-control
=============

Rewrite of a legacy application that interacts with X10 hardware. Initial functionality is to turn lights and A/C on and off based on a schedule.

Initial code is based on a series of articles availble here: http://www.jeremybytes.com/Downloads.aspx#LegacyRewrite

Current code can be run without hardware by using the "FakeCommander" object.
